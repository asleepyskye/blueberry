### If you have questions about how to use the bot...

You can ask any bot support questions, whatever they may be, in <#1319461648251097288>.\nIf you're brand new to the bot, and haven't already read the [**Getting Started Guide**](<https://pluralkit.me/start/>), we recommend you check that out before asking any questions.

### Have a suggestion for a bot feature?

<#468821582794588160> is the place to post any suggestions or feature requests. If you're not sure if something has been suggested before, check out [our Notion board of suggestions](<https://developing-cuckoo-ca7.notion.site/74576534b6f9446a8ca9aa8c30c4069c>) - that's where we keep track of everything people have requested.

### Is something not working right?

<#635146116144431149> is the place to report it. (If you're posting an error code given by the bot, please **copy-and-paste** that error code as text instead of sending a screenshot - it makes our lives much easier!)

### Have any questions, suggestions or bug reports for the dashboard?
