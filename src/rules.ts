      description: `
### 1️⃣ No discourse, no drama, no bigotry

If you want to argue, take it out of here. People blocking you is also not an excuse to bring it into the server. Don't try to ping people that have you blocked, and if someone asks you not to interact with them, respect that.\n\n**This rule also applies to expressing intolerance towards endogenic (or otherwise non-traumagenic) systems.** You're entitled to your opinions, whatever they may be, but don't express the hateful ones here.\n\nAdditionally, *screenshots from other servers are not allowed* (outside of getting support), as they're too often posted to bring drama from other servers into this space.

### 2️⃣ Don't try to intentionally trigger others

This server may not have a trigger list, but that's no excuse. Spoiler common triggers or don't bring them up at all.\n\nVenting is also not allowed in this server, as it commonly brings up sensitive topics and/or breaks rule 1.

### 3️⃣ Keep things "safe for work"!

This applies to images; usernames (including display names, when proxying); and message content. This is a public server with minors in it, and is **absolutely not the place for adult content.**

### 4️⃣ Keep off-topic talk out of the on-topic channels

This is a bot support server, first and foremost - not a space to socialize. Off-topic messages in any support or development channels will be deleted.\n\nIf you need to run any bot commands in this server, please do that in <#471385416595931176>. There is an off-topic channel also, which is locked behind a role - use \`?rank Chat Access\` in the aforementioned channel to get access.

### 5️⃣ No advertisements

This isn't the place. Don't share or request invites to Discord servers or group DMs, or discuss creating Discord servers and/or group DMs. Don't use this server to DM advertise, either.

If there is an issue that requires moderator attention, use the <@&846725339412693013> role. Pinging individual moderators is fine, but do be aware that people may be away and a different staff member might be able to help you sooner.
